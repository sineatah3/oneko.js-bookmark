# oneko.js

oneko.js is a script that you can put on websites but i decided that is simply not enough.

ive proceeded to do all my bullshittery and make it a bookmarklet for those of you who know them or use those blooket cheats
so ive decided to make a bookmarklet version of it changed it slightly and made it pretty cool i think this is also a slight fork of spicetify oneko.js because i do use two of the sprites from there and plan to add maybe one or two more and i have to fix the images or maybe just get rid of them but yeah just copy the text from the oneko-bookmarklet.txt make a bookmark edit it and paste it into the url on its own.
